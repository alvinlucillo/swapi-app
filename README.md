# Star Wars Trivia UI Project

As a Star Wars super fan that loves trivia, the goal is to develop a UI that allows users to list the film(s) and vehicle model(s) for Star Wars characters, aiding in preparation for trivia nights.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Locally Hosted Web Application**: The UI should be web-based and locally hosted.
- **Technology Stack**: Use any comfortable technology stack for development.
- **Character Search**: Feature a text box for entering character names.
- **Display Results**: Show films and vehicle models in a structured table.
- **Search Results Storage**: Ability to store and retrieve search results.
- **Data Source**: Use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) as the data source.
- **GraphQL Interface**: The UI should use GraphQL for querying and mutating data.
- **Database Integration**: Implement a database for storing search results.
- **Bonus Feature (Optional)**: If multiple characters are returned in a search, display results in separate tables for each character.

## Test Case

Searching “Darth Maul” should list “The Phantom Menace” and the vehicle model “FC-20 speeder bike”.
